                The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has re-started consultations with other ministries and government departments on the use of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in implementation of state-run services, senior
                government officials told The Indian Express.
              </p>
              <p>The IT Ministry had, as recently as October, planned to seek Cabinet nod on use of AI in implementation of certain government-run programmes, but the plan was deferred after some ministries raised objections.</p>

              <p>“The industry has flagged about 150 job options where AI could be used and the workforce could be put to better use. Some concerns of job losses have been highlighted and we are working to solve those,” a senior government official said.
              <p>The push for “judicious” use of AI technology has been flagged by “very senior government officials” after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the same in one of his speeches earlier this year, one of the officials said.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, the Prime Minister had — while addressing RAISE 2020 in October, a global AI summit organised by the IT Ministry — said that that while there were very few things which were as empowering and easily accessible as AI, it was equally important that the technology be used responsibly.</p></p>

            <p>THE MINISTRY of Earth Sciences (MoES) is developing an ‘Early Health Warning System’ which is expected to forecast the possibility of disease outbreaks in the country, officials have told The Indian Express.</p>
            <p>
              While the model currently in development, based on the relationship between weather changes and incidence is expected to predict outbreaks of vector-borne diseases, particularly malaria and diarrhoea, subsequently, it is likely to
              monitor non-communicable diseases as well, they added. MoES secretary M Rajeevan told The Indian Express, “There are certain diseases where weather patterns play a crucial role. Such as malaria, for which particular temperatures and
              rainfall patterns can approximately predict whether an area is likely to have an outbreak with fairly reasonable accuracy. What we are looking at is an advance warning of around two weeks.”

            <p>FC Goa’s life past Sergio Lobera may have begun on a promising note but the sheen is slowly starting to wear off – two losses in their last two games, this time to a Chennaiyin FC team, sees them languish in seventh spot.</p>

            <p>
              Fewer crosses, more interceptions, and just an overall better attacking approach saw Chennaiyin unleash their best football of the season and against a team no less than FC Goa. Bengaluru laboured past Odisha and NorthEast United were
              finally felled by Jamshedpur FC but Chennai’s attacking intent was the most enterprising aspect of round 7 of the Indian Super League.

            <p>
              Anirudh Thapa, Chhangte, and Brandon Fernandes – some of India’s current international midfielders were all playing prominent roles for their team in the clash. But one clearly stood above the rest. Usually for the national team, Thapa
              has been deployed deep in the midfield and rarely ventures into the final third. But for this Chennaiyin team, Thapa is a genuine midfield kingpin.
