            <p>The last round of talks between the government and farm unions was held on December 8 when Home Minister Amit Shah had held a meeting with the 13 representatives of farm unions.</p>
            <p>Maan claimed the organisation also receives vegetables from Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.</p>
            <p>
              In a five-page letter to Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab state president Dr Darshan Pal, Vivek Aggarwal, joint secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare said: “You are requested to share the details in respect to your
              doubts after having discussion with farm union leaders invited earlier, and inform the date for punah vaarta (next round of talks) according to your convenience, so that the matter can be resolved by holding a meeting again at Vigyan
              Bhawan, New Delhi; so that the current agitation can be ended soon.”

            <p>According to the chargesheet, the woman and Sandeep lived nearby and “he developed acquaintance with the victim two/three years back which gradually turned into love affair”</p>
            <p>
              The 19-year-old Dalit woman killed in Hathras was allegedly raped by four men after she rebuffed one of them, Sandeep, and this “change in their relationship” “aggravated his feelings” and “frustrated him”, the CBI has said in its
              chargesheet filed in the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chargesheet also has a scathing indictment of the Uttar Pradesh Police, stating that despite the woman naming three people when her statement was recorded on September 19, the name of only one was mentioned in the statement. It
              further states that “though victim alleged molestation, her medical examination regarding sexual assault was not conducted”.

            <p>While declining the couple's plea, Justice Anu Malhotra said on Wednesday that the prayers "are in the realm of speculation" and "no such orders in relation thereto can be granted presently".</p>
            <p>“We wouldn’t have been able to marry in Shahjahanpur, someone would have found out and stopped us,” said 25-year-old Shameem, who fled with 21-year-old Simran from their hometown in Uttar Pradesh last month.</p>
            <p>
              Fearing vigilantism in the name of ‘love jihad’ and with the UP Police clamping down on interfaith couples citing the newly promulgated Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, the interfaith couple had on
              December 16 petitioned the High Court, seeking protection not only from their families but also any coercive action by the UP Police.
